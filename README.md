In Android, 'themes' are an easy way to apply consistent formatting to your user interface (UI.) Defining a theme in advance not only saves you coding time in the long run, but it means that if you ever need to make UI adjustments, you only need to touch the code in one location. This saves you time and reduces the chances of human error.

'Themes' and 'styles' are often used almost interchangeably in Android tutorials. For the sake of clarity, we'll focus on themes in this tutorial, but in reality the only difference between a theme and a style is their scope:

A theme is a set of formatting rules applied across entire activities or applications.
A style is a set of formatting rules applied to a View.
